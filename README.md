# Movies Bot (Twitter)
This twitter bot tweets movies based on my criterea of "good movies".

### Functionalities:
* Daily suggestion of a movie.

## APIS
Im using "The Movie Database (TMDb)" API to get the movies. I filtrate the movies with some params to only obtain realative "new good movies" with a rate above 7(good movies in my opinion and new means above 2008).

## Packages
For this project I use [twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) npm package to facilitate the tweets interaction.

## Author's note:
Im looking foward to update this bot in order to have more funcitonalities. Stick around to find out new interactions with the bot and all the functionalities

If you want to create a bot I highly recommend this[repository](https://github.com/diegotf30/meme-bot), which is made in python and manage to interact with images.
